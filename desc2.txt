Added a ParticipantProfile class to represent a conversation participant
Created two user objects and replaced the sample data message authors with them
Added an event in the message card composable which is called when the profile image is clicked
Added a NavController and NavHost to the root of the composable hierarchy
Refactored composables into their own files
Created a profile composable to display a user profile
Made the view backgrounds fill the entire screen (max size)
Added navigation between the main view and a placeholder profile view
  OS back button/gesture works by default
Added a userId parameter to the profile view and a mock database of users to read for the profile view
Added a quick and dirty back button. Circular navigation is prevented by using `popBackStack` instead of `navigate` and `popUpTo` to go back, as intended.
