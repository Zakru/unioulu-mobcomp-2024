I updated Android studio since I had an old version without Jetpack in the templates
I created a new empty activity project
I created a composable function for displaying a message and added Material theming
Shaped the image using a modifier and added a border
Set text color from theme, which is based on device preferences
Styled the text using Material typography and shapes
I added the sample conversation dataset and a composable function to display it
The conversation function uses LazyColumn to avoid rendering elements that are out of view
The content automatically becomes scrollable
I added mutable state to the messages to enable expanding them
Added a "clickable" modifier to messages to toggle expansion on tap by mutating the state
Added animations and background for expanded messages
Holy this is so much better than the old XML way of creating UI
