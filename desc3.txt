Added an image selection view when clicking the profile image in "my" profile view
Abstracted profile images to an interface accepting a resource-based image or an image from a URI
Handle the image selection by assigning a URI image to the profile image
Undesired behavior: for now, the image is not updated in the profile view immediately

Instead of using the picked image directly, copy it into internal storage and use that file as the URI
Added a cleanup method to the ProfileImage interface, by default it does nothing but for URI images it
  deletes the file

Added a Room database to store user info. For now the code is special-cased to only handle "my" user,
as the other user's data cannot change.
(had to update Kotlin and Compose Compiler)

Unfortunately the image still does not update immediately as I cannot figure out how to correctly
update state after returning from an activity.
