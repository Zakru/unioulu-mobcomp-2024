Let's start off by moving the conversation into the database. To do this, we'll need to create an
entity and DAO for messages.

The conversation now needs to be populated from the sample data in a new database.

Added a message input field and send button to the bottom of the screen in the conversation view.
Sending the message saves it to the database and adds it to the end of the conversation.

Added microphone input to the app. There is a recording button which, when initially pressed,
requests audio recording permission. If granted, pressing the button down starts recording, and
releasing the button plays the recording back.

To achieve this, I had to create a button that listens for low-level interactions to handle the
press-release functionality, including built-in "cancel" events (i.e. touch moved out of the
button). I then created a MediaRecorder to record microphone input and a MediaPlayer to play it
back.
