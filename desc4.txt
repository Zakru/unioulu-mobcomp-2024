Looked into creating notifications
Followed guide in Android documentation to create notifications
Registered a notification channel
Created a convenience method for building notifications
Tried requesting the POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission, but the prompt is never shown. The permission
  is not listed in the app's settings. Notifications do not appear to require a permission.
  This is probably caused by testing on an Android 11 device, which allegedly does not require
  permission for notifications.
A test notification is now sent when the app starts, without asking for permission.

Register the main activity as a sensor listener on app resume
Added a sensor data view which displays up-to-date sensor data
Needed to figure out how to pass live data to a composable using a dependency extension function
  Sensor data seems to reuse the same float array for every event, so it must be copied every time
  to update some equality condition.

Now, to add the background notification, I had to add schedule an alarm on a button press
Callback schedules AlarmManager in 10 seconds with a pending intent to fire a notification
